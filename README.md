main.py will run the algorithm for either an LFR-graph or imported graph, set the booleans to true when you want to investigate certain properties of the graphs (#triangles, #wedges, et cetera). When enabling PRNibble, the PRNibble algorithm will find the conductance subsets based on different seed sets.
